#+TITLE: tonybtw.com

* About
This is the source for [[https://tonybtw.com][tonybtw.com]], a Hugo-based static site.  
The repository includes a =flake.nix= so you can get a reproducible Hugo environment with Nix.

* Requirements
- [[https://nixos.org/download.html][Nix]] installed  
- Flakes enabled (add =experimental-features = nix-command flakes= to =~/.config/nix/nix.conf=)

* Usage
Clone the repo and enter the development shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/tonybanters/tonybtw.com
cd tonybtw.com
nix develop
#+END_SRC

Inside the shell, run Hugo:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
hugo serve
#+END_SRC

This starts the development server at http://localhost:1313.

* Alternate dev shell
If you prefer =nix= to start the server automatically:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix develop .#serve
#+END_SRC

This launches =hugo serve= right away.
